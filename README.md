# Geometry-Tool
Geometry Tool is an aplication which is used to help solve math problems in the field of analitic geometry.
The user is required enter the name and coordinates of points, coefficients of lines and parabolas (depending on what is needed in the funcionaliry).
The program has 11 main functionalities:
1. Enter 2 points;
   Find the equation of the line, passing throug the 2 points.
   
2. Enter 1 point and 1 line;
   Check whether the point lies on the line.
   
3. Enter 1 point and 1 line;
   Find the equation of the line, crossing the point and parallel to the line.
   
4. Enter 1 point and 1 line;
   Find the equation of the line, crossing the point and perpendicular to the line.
   
5. Enter 2 lines;
   Find the coordinates of the point of interception of the 2 lines.
   
6. Enter 3 points;
   Find the equation of a height of the triangle, formed by the 3 points.
   
7. Enter 3 points;
   Find the equation of a median of the triangle, formed by the 3 points.

8. Enter 3 points;
   Find the equation of a bisection of the triangle, formed by the 3 points.
   
9. Enter 1 point and 1 parabola;
   Find the equation of the lines, tangent to the parabola and crossing the point.
  
10. Enter 1 parabola and 1 line;
    Find the coordinates of the points of interception of the parabola and the line.
    
11. Enter 4 lines;
    Determine the type of the quadrilateral, formed by the 4 lines.
